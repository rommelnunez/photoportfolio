<h4>Rommel Nunez is a portrait photographer from Tamaulipas, Mexico based in New York City. He is a student of Computer Science pursuing a minor in English & Comparative Literature at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 
    With a deep affinity for surrealist portraiture, Rommel regularly shoots with visual and musical artists including Christina Li, Jackie Marchal, and Eva Westphal. 
    Rommel has produced product photography work for Salvos, Guayaki and his work has been published in Ratrock Magazine and The Columbia Daily Spectator. Rommel’s diverse background in music has led him to produce, direct, and film numerous music videos with talent such as singer/songwriters Vincent Le, and, most recently, Eva Westphal. Following his independent coverage of the 2021 Graduate Workers’ Union strike on Columbia’s campus, his photographs were reposted by @left_voice and published on <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/columbia-graduate-workers-organize-to-vote-no-on-proposed-contract/">their website.</a></h4>
